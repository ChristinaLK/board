Discussion points
- keynotes in the morning would give a theme for the day. We can ask the community what they theme of the days could be.
Suggestion for the keynote speakers?
- round of lightning talks to setup the theme - community driving the topics/organization
- A semi-unconference style. Example: http://www.opencon2017.org
- Panel session
- A poster session could happend during the evening session the first night. Could be used to pick the lightening talks +1
- AWorld cafe format for a session on day-2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cafe): participants can propose a topic/idea for the discussion
- ARemember that different types of activiites (posters, lightening talks, keynotes) attract different people. 
- AMentor-mentee lunch? +1+1+1

Feedback on the program
- There are a variety of schedules, so let's decide on how long the program should be - two or three days?
- Timing of parellel sessions, how many of each thing should there be
- Keeping in mind that conference site would need to have enough space to host things like workshops, lightning sessions, speakers/breakouts - so how many are we aiming for?
- How to we figure out the interest and timeing of concurrent sessions?
- Number of rooms: A big hall for the keynpte speaker, and based on the location the number of parallel session can be decided
- GOOD PLACE TO START: consider an estimated number of attendees (estimate ~120 participants ?)
- Depends on time/location - continent

We will each comment on the draft proposal this week. 

## Develop survey to send out to the group to gauge excitement and participate
We need to develope a survey to gague interest and ability to attend. However, we will postpone distributing this until we received bids.

##  Determine how to include NumFocus or other fiscallly responsible partners in the planning
- Maneesh talks to NumFocus every Thursday. Sue McClathcy is secretary
- Mateusz, Sue, and Christain have been talking about finances. 
- Fotis (and maybe Mark) will be included in these financial discussions
