### Discussion points:

1) __Last meeting with NumFOCUS__

  - Fotis gave a Brief update (See below for the details)
  - Mark, Fotis, Maneesha and Belinda spoke to Lyn, Nancy and Leah
  - the following suggestions were given: 
  - Locations: 
    - we can go for th open bid, but were suggested to look for the locations such as University sites in UK/US, that could be interested in hosting the Carpentry Con
    - Universities are more appropriate as they are open and well organized for such events

2) __Sponsorships__

  - This should start right after the location has been decided
  - We can look for sponsors who might be interested in sponsoring the conference
  - how can the sponsors gain from this event?
    - How to allow visibilities to them (advertise on the website/poster/event sites)
    - WHo could be their target audience for a potential collaboration
    - They can be suggested to sponsor certain specific part of the event (poster session, breakout session etc.)
  - Gather travel grant for the young scientists from specific location
    - How can we handle reimbursements (exchange rate)?
    - NumFocus will be able deal with the allocation of the budgets obtained from the sponsorship

3) __Timeline__

    - Decision of the location by September 2017
    - Aim to have the event dates in Spring 2018

4) __Discussion on the bid and agenda__

  - Links of the documents are given on the top
  - Migrate the BID and Agenda to https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon repository (access)
  - It looks improved now, but should be reviewed again after the bids are received and the location is decided
  - Check the guidelines by the NumFocus to take care of any legal (for example, childcare related etc.) issues
    - How many people might want childcare? (we need to find a way to guage interests)
  - Breakout session hosting (invite volunteers)
  - A survey to gague interest and ability to attend. However, we will postpone distributing this until we received bids.
     - What kind of survey can we use?
  - How can we get feedback after the conference?
    - A short survey link to be sent/shared on site/twitter/via email
    - Have a wrap up session and collect one thing from the attendees about what they learnt and took back from this event

5) __Location related issues__

- _Country suggestions:_
  - This topic will need more focus in order to be more inclusive for wider number of audience
  - USA: might exclude many people who need visa and will have troubles getting it but other countries might exclude those who can not leave USA
  - Toronto: a possible option as it is closer to the USA
    - Google office might be able to offer their space
  - Europe:
  - Netherlands (Mateusz)
  - Ireland: Dublin
  - Spain (Mateusz will check with Inigo from San Sebastian)
  - Italy: Rome (we can ask Allegra Via for the university location: Mateusz and Malvika)
  - Germany: 
    - Frankfurt/Dusseldorf/Berlin
    - Heidelberg (EMBL/DKFZ/Uni Heidelberg: Malvika will talk to them and update)

- _Event venue related issues:_
  - A few important questions for the location providers (before the bid is shared):
    - The cost of the event - how much would it be for the venue, how much would local housing be?
    - Total capacity of the event venue
    - Is there a local person to help coordinate
    - Technical support
  - Rooms for breakout sessions

6) _Agenda:_
  - 3-day agenda: two main days with keynotes + workshops/open third day (optional).
  - Idea can be collected on the day-1 on a white board (participants can add their suggestion)
   
7) _Next meeting:_
  - Next meeting on the 7th August
    - Closer to the community call (17th August)- what should be discussed (should be announced) 
  - Check with Belinda and update on a time that is suitable for Australian time as well
  - Proposed time: 3:00 PM CEST
    - Change connection for the meeting to Zoom- we should use Zoom next time. BlueJeans will have expired.
