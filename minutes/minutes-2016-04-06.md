<h3>Motion #2016-04-06/4</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jonah Duckles.</p>
<p>Text: Allow Executive Director to pursue a “Royal Society of New Zealand Catalyst Leaders Fellowship”.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: Executive Diretor is applying in conjunction with The University of Otago and NeSI for a Fellowship that “Supports exceptional individuals from any country outside New Zealand to catalyse science and innovation capability and capacity in New Zealand for a minimum of 4 weeks per year for up to 3 years”. We’re working on ways that the effort would support activities in New Zealand to test our model for top-down coordination (NeSI) and bottom up (U of Otago) approaches to expansion of Software and Data Carpentry activities. This would have me working to develop a strategy and playbook for how we can engage at various levels to expand Software Carpentry.</p>
