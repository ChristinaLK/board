<h2>Motions</h2>

<h3>Motion #2016-04-21/1</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jason Wiliams.</p>
<p>Text: Approve call for Subcommittees and Task Forces.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: Software Carpentry will invite community members to proposal new subcommittees (more than six months life span) and task forces (less than six months life span). Proposals can include request to financial support.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-04-21/2</h3>
<p>Presenter: Jason Wiliams.</p>
<p>Text: Approve Time Zone Rules for Steering Committee Meetings</p>
<p>Resolution: Rejected.</p>
<p>Details: Future Steering Committee meetings will start with a video conference meeting of one hour. After the video conference meeting we use Slack for 24 hours to answer questions of members that couldnâ€™t attend the video conference meeting. At the end of this 24 hours period, votes are computed.</p>
<p>This motion was rejected because it has many looks that would be difficult to keep track.</p>

<h3>Motion #2016-04-21/3</h3>
<p>Presenter: Bill Mills.</p>
<p>Text: Clarify Fee Schedule Text</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Details: Language around fee schedule on the public-facing website was unclear, making fees seem mandatory for self-organized workshops, leading to unnecessary fee waiver requests. We could change the text so it does not change any fees, but makes more explicit what is required when. Also drops commitment to administrative support for self-organized workshops.</p>



<h2>Discussions</h2>
