# Mentoring Subcommittee Roles and Membership

## Roles

There are multiple roles for participating in mentoring subcommittee activities: 

### Roles for any SWC/DC instructor or instructor trainee

* [Discussion Session Host/Co-Host](roles/discussion-hosts.md)
	- Lead a discussion among fellow instructors about recent or upcoming workshops
* [Mentor](roles/mentors.md)
	- Work with a small group of new instructors to provide support and guidance
* [Mentee](roles/mentees.md)
	- Work with a mentor and fellow new instructors to prepare for participation

Anyone who is a certified instructor, or in the process of becoming certified 
can participate in our activities in the roles above. 

### Roles for mentoring committee members

* [Chair and Vice-Chair](roles/chair-and-vice.md)
	- Coordinate mentoring efforts, organize and lead mentoring committee meetings
* [Secretary](roles/secretary.md)
	- Take notes, submit official minutes
* [Steering Committee Liaison](roles/liaison.md)
	- Facilitate communication between the steering committee and mentoring committee
* [Discussion Coordinators](discussion-coordinators.md)
	- Coordinate volunteer hosts for instructor discussion sessions, contact instructors

These roles are filled by [members]() of the mentoring subcommittee, in order to support 
the operation and activities of the subcommittee.  

### Choosing Mentoring Committee Member Roles

These roles are filled yearly, in February.  Members can volunteer for any role.  
Roles are filled in the order listed above, first by consensus (if it exists) and 
then by a majority vote if there is not consensus.  Whenever possible roles should
 be filled by unique people; however, one person may hold up to two positions

In the case that a member is not able to fulfill the duties of their role for the 
full term, a member will be chosen to fill that role until the time of the next 
turnover.  

## Mentoring Committee Membership

To join the mentoring committee as a member, you must have helped or instructed 
at a Software or Data Carpentry workshop in the past 8 months and be either a 
certified instructor or in process of becoming certified.  

A mentoring committee member is defined as someone who has attended at least 8 
mentoring committee meetings in the past 12 months, or participated in mentoring 
committee activities (e.g. discussion sessions, mentoring program) in the past 
4 months.  

All mentoring committee members should join the committee email list in order 
to remain up-to-date.
