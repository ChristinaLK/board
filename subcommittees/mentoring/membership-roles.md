Anyone who is a certified instructor, or in the process of becoming certified 
can participate in our activities in the roles above. 

### Roles for mentoring committee members

These roles are filled by [members](#mentoring-committee-membership) of the 
mentoring subcommittee, in order to support 
the operation and activities of the subcommittee.  Current 
members in these roles are listed in the [README](README.md)

### Choosing Mentoring Committee Member Roles

These roles are filled yearly, in February.  Members can volunteer for any role.  
Roles are filled in the order listed above, by a majority vote.  Whenever possible roles should
be filled by unique people; however, if there are not enough volunteers, 
one person may hold up to two positions.  

In the case that a member is not able to fulfill the duties of their role for the 
full term, a member will be chosen to fill that role until the time of the next 
turnover.  

## Mentoring Committee Membership

Mentoring committee membership is open to anyone who is: 
* a certified instructor

* active in the SWC/DC community as a helper, instructor, or contributor

All mentoring committee members are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/), and
