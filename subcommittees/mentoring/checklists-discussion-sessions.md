# Checklists - Instructor Discussion Sessions

This document contains checklists for the people involved 
in instructor discussion sessions.  The full procedure is described 
on [this page](procedure-discussion-session.md).  

## For Hosts and Co-Hosts

Discussion sessions are organized and conducted through this etherpad: 

[http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion)

### In advance
- [ ] Sign up for a slot on the etherpad. 

### Before the discussion (day of)
- [ ] If necessary, split the participants into two groups.  
	* Rule of thumb: split when the number of workshops represented is greater than 5.
	* There is a second BlueJeans room on the etherpad if you need to split the group. 
	* Try to balance the number of people de-briefing, getting help, and checking out between the two groups.  
- [ ] Coordinate with your host/co-host about who will lead and who will take notes

### During the discussion
- [ ] Sign on and lead the meeting
	- You can use the agenda at the bottom of the etherpad as a starting point/outline for discussion, as you choose
	- Don't feel like you have to answer all the questions - draw on the discussion 
	participants to answer each other's questions.  
	- If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to 
ask questions.  
- [ ] Take notes, if possible, about meeting discussion

### After the discussion
- [ ] Archive the etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner.  
- [ ] Copy your notes to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQTkNCev9AzAlA464jUa8ifFaTx_8mb1NX6xvUbaGvM/edit) and label with the date and which session you led.  
- [ ] Indicate the participation of those who are going through instructor training by: 
	- Emailing the instructor training coordinator (currently Greg Wilson) with the names 
		of those participating as part of their training checkout
	- OR
	- Logging into AMY, and marking the discussion as complete
- [ ] Clear the information from your session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the etherpad. 
- [ ] Optional: write a blog post about interesting points that came up in discussion; see 
[this template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) as a starting point.

## For Discussion Session Organizer

This may apply to the Mentoring Chair, Software Carpentry administrator, or 
another volunteer.  

### Organizing meetings
- [ ] Recruit hosts for discussion sessions on a regular basis.  
- [ ] Every Monday, email instructors of workshops in the past week (Monday to 
Sunday), with the 
[post-workshop email](files/post_workshop_email.txt).  
- [ ] Every other Monday, email instructors teaching in the next 4 weeks (starting 
on Thursday of that week), with the [pre-workshop email](files/pre_workshop_email.txt)

### Follow up
- [ ] Facilitate discussion among hosts about the discussion sessions.  
- [ ] Ask for additional questions to be added temporarily to the agenda.
