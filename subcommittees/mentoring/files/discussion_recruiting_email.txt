Greetings, all!  

This is an invitation to contribute to the Software and Data Carpentry communities in a very low-commitment, lots-of-fun way!  

The mentoring committee runs weekly discussion sessions for Software/Data Carpentry instructors and we welcome you to participate as a general participant or co-host.  The discussions are centered around preparing lessons and debriefing how workshops went, but often expand to include general sharing of teaching tips, tricks and ideas.  Discussions are an hour long, require no work outside that hour, and you can sign up as frequently or infrequently as you like.  

[Optional: We're emailing this particular group of people because we know you've been involved with Software/Data Carpentry in the past, but might not have time in your current schedules to teach at a full 2-day workshop or contribute more actively, and we hope you'll be interested in participating in this way! ]

I've hosted several discussions over the past few months, and have always found it a lot of fun.  Even on days when I think "I'm so busy, why did I sign up for today?", I always leave the discussion thinking that it was enjoyable and worthwhile.  (See twitter for verification: https://twitter.com/_christinaLK/status/742748905947967488.  :))
