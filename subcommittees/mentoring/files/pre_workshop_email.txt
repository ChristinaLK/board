Dear instructors,

If you are receiving this message, you are scheduled to teach a Software
or Data Carpentry workshop over the next several weeks.

The Software Carpentry mentoring committee hosts discussion sessions
every week to share ideas and experiences among instructors.   If you
have any questions or concerns about your upcoming workshop, or are
interested in chatting with other instructors about your or their own
experiences teaching Software/Data Carpentry, we encourage you to
attend!

Upcoming discussions will occur on (date), (date), and (date). 
Each date has two time slots to accommodate time zones.  You can sign up
for the most convenient time on this etherpad:
* http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion
On the day of the meeting, connection information will be posted on the
same etherpad.

We encourage all workshop co-insturctors to attend the same discussion 
session for maxmium benefit to your growth as an insturctor and member 
of the community. 

We hope to see you in the next few weeks!

Cheers,

Christina Koch
