Dear instructors,

If you are receiving this message, you have recently instructed at a
Data or Software Carpentry workshop.

The Software Carpentry mentoring committee hosts instructor discussions
every week in order to hear how workshops have gone, and we invite you
to attend a discussion in the next two weeks to share about your recent
workshop.  Even if you have attended a debriefing discussion before, we
would appreciate feedback on any workshops you have done since then - we
value hearing about your experiences.

Co-hosting a discussion session is a great way to share your expertise with both new and experienced instructors. Please join us as a co-host to enliven the conversation, or to take notes if you prefer. Discussion sessions often feature 2-3 seasoned instructors as co-hosts, and can be a lot of fun.

Upcoming discussions will occur on (date) and (date).  Each date has two
time slots to accommodate time zones.  You can sign up for the most
convenient time on this etherpad: 
* http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion 
On the day of the meeting, connection information will be posted on the 
same etherpad.

We hope to see you in the next two weeks!

Cheers,
