# The Mentoring Subcommittee

## Purpose and Scope

The Mentoring Subcommittee was established in 2015 to develop and maintain a mentorship program to support instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. We help promote community-building and networking by providing (virtual) spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss strategies for overcoming challenges. 

## What We Do

### Instructor Discussion Sessions

Each week, volunteers host two instructor discussion sessions. The sessions provide a forum where experienced and novice instructors can discuss past and/or upcoming workshops. Instructors who have just taught, are about to teach, or have just completed instructor training will  receive an email invitation to these meetings, but these sessions are open to anyone. 

To find an upcoming session, visit this link: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

### Mentoring Program

This program supports instructors who are new to our community by matching them with a personal Mentor. Mentors will guide small groups (~4-5) of Mentees, holding meetings for their Mentees to do things like practice teaching, ask questions about workshop logistics, and brush up on lesson content, depending on their needs and interests. 

See [this page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/mentoring-program/blob/master/program-outline.md) for a full outline of the program.  

### Mentoring Committee Meetings

The mentoring committee itself meets regularly to evaluate current activities, and propose
new activities.  Minutes of past meetings are available [here](minutes).
