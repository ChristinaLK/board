# Procedure - Instructor Discussion Session

This document describes how instructor discussion sessions
are organized and conducted.

## Terminology

-   **SCF**: Software Carpentry Foundation.

-   **DC**: Data Carpentry.

-   **Instructor discussion session**: an online meeting
    where instructors share experiences from teaching and
    obtain information while preparing to teach.

-   **Facilitator**: is a member of the Mentoring Subcommittee
    who hosts a discussion session.

## Motivation

1.  SCF and DC are community based projects
    and the community needs opportunity to interact.

2.  SCF and DC believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study",
    and evidence-based education so instructors need opportunity to share experiences.

3. SCF and DC are continuing to increase the number of instructors
   and develop new lessons. New instructors would like to hear from 
   experienced teachers who have recently taught to help prepare for upcoming workshops.

## Before the meeting

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing
the instructor discussion sessions so that

-   each month has at least four discussion sessions,

-   instructors are notified at least one week in advance and

-   each session has at least one facilitator (preferably two) to conduct the discussion.

Meeting scheduling will be coordinated via (etherpad)[http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion].

The dates of instructor discussion sessions are also listed
in the SCF community calendar,

Email invitations should be sent to three groups of instructors:

- instructors who have taught in the previous two weeks

- instructors who are preparing to teach in the next 4-6 weeks

- folks who have recently completed instructor training and need to
  attend a discussion session to complete their checkout

The contact information for the first two groups is available in (AMY)[https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/]. 
The chair of the mentoring subcommittee, as well as all members of the SCF Steering committee, 
should have access to AMY. Newly trained instructors should be directed to instructor discussion sessions 
following completion of instructor training.

## During the meeting

Meetings will be hosted via (etherpad)[http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion].

Each instructor discussion session session must have at least one facilitator
from the mentoring subcommittee (although two hosts are preferred). 

The **facilitator** is responsible for: 

- hosting the meeting and facilitating discussion using the agenda described on the 
(etherpad)[http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion]. 

- ensuring instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.

- aggregating feedback from instructors who have recently taught.

- engaging newly trained instructors and evaluating their participating using a subset of 
questions described in the checkout procedure.

- encouraging attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.


## After the meeting

The facilitator of the meeting should report back to the lead instructor trainer and 
describe whether newly trained instructors participating as a part of the checkout procedure 
were engaged and could answer target questions described in the checkout procedure.

Each month, the facilitators of discussion sessions will
coordinate to write a blog post summarizing the topics discussed.
