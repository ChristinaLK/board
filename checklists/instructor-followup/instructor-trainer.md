Immediately after students have completed instructor training please
send this concluding email:

    Thanks again for taking part in Software Carpentry instructor training
    - we're pleased to have you on the team.  When you have a minute,
    please:

    1. Take a moment to go to AMY [1] and update your profile so we know where
        you are and what you're comfortable teaching - that will help us
        match you with workshops.

    2. Send me a three-line bio and a photo to add to our website (see
        our team page [2] for examples).

    3. Make sure you're on the 'instructors' mailing list (signup at [3])
        so that you'll get notice about upcoming workshops that need
        instructors - if you'd like us to help you organize one where you
        are, please give me a shout.

    Please also think about joining the discussion list (signup also at
    [3]) - it's relatively low traffic, and high signal-to-noise, and it'd
    be great to have your input. The SWC community also gathers on our
    Slack channel [4] for real-time chat (get yourself an invite at [5]).

    Hope to teach with you some day,
    Thanks,
    {{YOUR NAME HERE}}
